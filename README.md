### HiðŸ‘‹**Thingalink/Thingalink** is âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ 

There is 4 years worth of versions being distilled into a new attempt
something is an anything til it is your thing
object at the core of the language but not fully harnessed without returning to specifics
Class HasAnObjectAndKnowsHowToPlugItIn is my quest

prime goal is ease of use
Awkward is to be automated
minimize the hassle of the providing of parameters
Keep your spaghetti on your own plate
Code that can be driven once the trunk is loaded up.

There were several attempts to automate casting. the last version abandoned that code
I kinda miss it but need to rethink how

Using liked lists in no way obsoletes collections/generic
Rather the stucture is to facilitate the calling of iterating funtions rather than typing out yet another loop structure
Avoid writing unique code for things that are not a unique process
