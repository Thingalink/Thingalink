### HiðŸ‘‹**Thingalink/Thingalink** is âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ 

The foundation of these ideas trace back to a 2005 Word Association Dictionary I built in C++.
Lists of Words and a selector on sourcing the also displayed collections. Is A lists and included ins. And plurals. Lists of. Lists froms and lists to.
Any lists items could be made as source category for an infinite next page. Naturally sourced parameters interlinkable mobius strip style.
Data had because it came connected.  Links part of baggage that came with what was made.  A Data sack.  Automatic Crud generation by being connected to what it is and where it might be.  Branching out into any list and a data entering.  A growable connected lump of data.  Not a query to be found. 
A few hundered hours completed the interface.  Prooving the value of transversal navigation of data made a need to put a thousands more into the contents of the data. 
Back then individually packing out and the packing in was a train wreck. Doing work created more work than it completed by leaving possibilities of uncompleted possible nodes.  Being a database means it need to be sold to be filled out fully. The data entry task as big as the data you choose to put into it
Selling it was never got around to timed with leaving Maine again and also the mind disruption paradigm shift moving into .Net realm
My Mind never back around to the Dictionary idea when life just made it not the topic and I only had a few years for stay-at-Dadism. 
In ~2008 I designed an ORM in visual basic tested up to 12 million record sets.  A c# version was built in 2013 and eventually expanded to automate data control binding.  That version maybe I guess falls under work for hire so I had to leave it behind.
2019 I started the attempt to work object first and allow myself to not need the databases.
So I have not rewritten the ORM stuff now exploring the concept as a graph form database.
There are 4 years worth of versions being distilled into this new attempt
These idea have been tested as a foundational library to the app that produced https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m47JKcycOGE and other videos on the Glorbular Toad channel.  The engine built upon kinda sorta in its iterations diconnected from that app's independant purpose.
Major rollback of features in version 4 of that app triggered some redesign of the objects here
Version 5 uncategorized a number of smaller libraries into 1 project to refeel the reasons for dividing the specifics of that app from the helper objects
The version 5 library extends into providing a generic app foundation.  It is specific to windows but still wants possibility of porting
This is meant as a common minimal for working with Things without full adoption of the app foundation library
The dividing line between that code and what belongs in this is still undefined

There were several attempts to automate casting. the last version abandoned that code
I kinda miss it but need to rethink how

Handling scema should be beyond the scope of this library but is key to understanding some of the design descisions
This is the basement of a house that can't be seen from here.  There is stuctural support for easing the awkwardness of generic handling
This library doesn't define that but provides placeholders for later.  Have metadata without incurring the cost of reflection is a goal.



something is an anything til it is your thing
object is at the core of the language but not fully harnessed without returning to specifics
Class HasAnObjectAndKnowsHowToPlugItIn is my quest
The difference between anything as a haphazzard convenience and any thing expected or allowed to contain anything needs scaffolding

prime goal is ease of use.  Awkward is to be automated.
Code that can be driven once the trunk is loaded up.  Minimize the hassle of the providing of parameters.
Keep your spaghetti on your own plate.  I had to put sketchi in the fridge to keep this only doing this
Avoid writing unique code for things that are not a unique process 


Using liked lists in no way obsoletes collections/generic
Rather the stucture is to facilitate the calling of iterating funtions rather than typing out yet another loop structure
