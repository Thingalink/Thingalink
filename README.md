### HiðŸ‘‹**Thingalink/Thingalink** is âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ 

There is 4 years worth of versions being distilled into a new attempt
This is a foundational library to the app that produced https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m47JKcycOGE and other videos on the Glorbular Toad channel 
The foundation of these ideas trace back to an ORM I designed in visual basic circa 2008
A c# version was built in 2013 and eventually expanded to automate data control binding.  That version maybe I guess falls under work for hire so I had to leave it behind.
2019 I started the attempt to work object first and allow myself to not need the databases.
So I have not rewritten the ORM stuff now exploring the concept as a graph database.
Handling scema should be beyond the scope of this library but is key to understanding some of the design descisions
This is the basement of a house that can't be seen from here.  There is stuctural support for easing the awkwardness of generic handling
This library doesn't define that but provides placeholders for later.  Have metadata without incurring the cost of reflection is a goal.

Major rollback of features in version 4 of that app triggered some redesign of the objects here
Version 5 uncategorized a number of smaller libraries into 1 project to refeel the reasons for dividing the specifics of that app from the helper objects
The version 5 library extends into providing a generic app foundation.  It is specific to windows but still wants possibility of porting
This is meant as a common minimal for working with Things without full adoption of the app foundation library
The dividing line between that code and what belongs in this is still undefined

something is an anything til it is your thing
object is at the core of the language but not fully harnessed without returning to specifics
Class HasAnObjectAndKnowsHowToPlugItIn is my quest
The difference between anything as a haphazzard convenience and any thing expected or allowed to contain anything needs scaffolding

prime goal is ease of use.  Awkward is to be automated.
Code that can be driven once the trunk is loaded up.  Minimize the hassle of the providing of parameters.
Keep your spaghetti on your own plate.  I had to put sketchi in the fridge to keep this only doing this


There were several attempts to automate casting. the last version abandoned that code
I kinda miss it but need to rethink how

Using liked lists in no way obsoletes collections/generic
Rather the stucture is to facilitate the calling of iterating funtions rather than typing out yet another loop structure
Avoid writing unique code for things that are not a unique process
